Based on the provided findings, there is only one issue identified - a 10GB "zombie" disk that is not attached to any instance. To fix this, we can add a resource block to delete the unused disk.

Here's the `git diff` to address the finding:

```diff
diff --git a/main.tf b/main.tf
index 4d4d5d9..d4d2d9e 100644
--- a/main.tf
+++ b/main.tf
@@ -49,4 +49,10 @@ resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo_bucket" {
   tags = {
     Name = "DemoBucket"
   }
 }
+
+resource "aws_ebs_volume" "unused_volume" {
+  availability_zone = aws_subnet.demo_subnet.availability_zone
+  size              = 10
+  deletion_protection = false
+}
```

The added resource block `aws_ebs_volume` will delete the 10GB unused volume identified in the findings.
