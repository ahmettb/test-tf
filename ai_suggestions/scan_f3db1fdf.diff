The changes made are:

1. Removed the risky rules (open ports 22 and 80) from the "DemoSecurityGroup" security group. This is a security best practice to limit access to only the necessary ports.
2. Removed the `cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]` from the ingress rules, which allows access from any IP address. This should be replaced with a more restrictive set of IP addresses or security groups that require access.

These changes will help improve the security of the resources created by the Terraform code.
